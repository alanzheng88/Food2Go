# Description: 
    In today's world, people can lead a hectic, always on-the-go lifestyle. 
    Food2Go is a website that offers people a convenient and time-saving way 
    of getting diversified food. Often is the cases are when people are unable 
    to enjoy a nice meal due to time constraint, inconvenience or even 
    indecisiveness.
    Food2Go not only allows people to browse, search and review restaurants, 
    the website is allowed the option of having the food delivered to them.
    Food2Go is partnered with restaurants, helping the restaurateurs to 
    spread awareness and generate revenues for their business.

    by cutting out travel time, wait in line and deal with a busy restaurant 
    setting.
